# Mallampati Classification

Mallampati classification is an indication to predict whether a patient might have crowded airways. According to the scale, there are four classes with increasing severity of airway crowding which may be an indicator of obstructive sleep apnea as reported in multiple studies. Conventionally Mallampati scale is manually identified by an expert in the clinic, but the same can be done by assessing the image of the oral cavity of a person. In this regard, the objective of this study is to develop a deep learning framework to perform Mallampati classification using the oral cavity images of individuals. The proposed framework for Mallampati classification develops a loss function by combining the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty principles to improve the reliability of predictions of the ConvNeXt model for image classification. The experimental analysis was performed on a dataset of 262 subjects acquired from the sleep lab at a local hospital, which demonstrates that the proposed framework performs better than the state-of-the-art in terms of common evaluation metrics. Notably, experimental results reveal that the proposed uncertainty principle performs well as the experiments were conducted on all states of the arts with and without using this principle.
